## Key Findings

### 1. Combined LightGBM Approach is Superior
- **Best Model**: Combined seq7 with 67 total features (18 engineered + 49 sequential)
- **Performance**: AUC 0.8356 vs baseline 0.7947 (+5.1% improvement)
- **Architecture**: LightGBM handles mixed feature types better than neural networks

### 2. Feature Importance Analysis
**Sequential features are more important than engineered features:**
- Sequential features: 66.8% of total importance
- Engineered features: 33.2% of total importance

**Top 5 Most Important Features:**
1. `daily_gross_lag_3` (Sequential) - 32.0
2. `rolling_vol_7` (Engineered) - 30.0
3. `daily_volume_lag_5` (Sequential) - 21.0
4. `daily_pnl_lag_6` (Sequential) - 20.0
5. `large_loss_threshold` (Engineered) - 19.0

**Most Important Sequential Features by Type:**
1. `daily_volume` - 83.0 total importance
2. `daily_pnl` - 77.0 total importance
3. `daily_gross` - 71.0 total importance
4. `daily_fees` - 70.0 total importance
5. `n_trades` - 66.0 total importance

**Most Important Lag Days:**
1. 3 days ago - 89.0 total importance
2. 6 days ago - 72.0 total importance
3. 4 days ago - 69.0 total importance
4. 5 days ago - 65.0 total importance

### 3. Architecture Comparison
- **LightGBM with combined features**: Best performance (0.836 AUC)
- **LightGBM with engineered only**: Good baseline (0.795 AUC)
- **Neural Networks (LSTM/CNN)**: Underperformed (~0.68 AUC)

### 4. Sequence Length Analysis
- **7-day sequences**: Best performance (0.836 AUC)
- **3-day sequences**: Good performance (0.768 AUC)
- **5-day sequences**: Moderate performance (0.767 AUC)
- Longer sequences capture more temporal patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Feature Engineering
- **18 Engineered Features**: EWMA, rolling volatility, Sortino ratio, profit factor, drawdown, behavioral metrics
- **49 Sequential Features**: 7 raw features Ã— 7 lag days, flattened into single vector
- **Total**: 67 features per sample

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: LightGBM Classifier
- **Training**: Per-trader models with expanding window validation
- **Features**: Combined engineered + flattened sequential data
- **Validation**: Temporal split to prevent data leakage

### Data Processing
- **Sequence Length**: 7 days of historical data
- **Raw Features**: daily_pnl, daily_gross, daily_fees, daily_volume, n_trades, gross_profit, gross_loss
- **Missing Data**: Median imputation for stability
- **Extreme Values**: Clipped to [-1e6, 1e6] range

## Production Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation
**Use Combined seq7 approach for production deployment:**
- Expected AUC: 0.8356
- Features: 18 engineered + 49 sequential = 67 total
- Architecture: LightGBM with per-trader models
- Training: Expanding window with temporal validation

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Deploy Combined seq7 model** as primary risk prediction system
2. **Monitor feature importance** for model drift detection
3. **Implement expanding window retraining** on weekly basis
4. **Track sequential feature patterns** (3-6 day lags most important)
5. **Maintain engineered features** as they provide stable baseline performance

### Fallback Strategy
- Keep LightGBM Engineered Only model as backup (0.795 AUC)
- Simpler architecture with 25 features
- More interpretable and stable over time

## Conclusion

The combined approach successfully demonstrates that:
1. **Domain knowledge + raw data = optimal performance**
2. **LightGBM handles mixed feature types better than neural networks**
3. **Sequential patterns from 3-6 days ago are most predictive**
4. **Longer sequences (7 days) capture more temporal complexity**
5. **5.1% AUC improvement justifies additional complexity**

This represents a significant advancement in trader risk prediction, combining the best of traditional feature engineering with modern sequential modeling techniques.
