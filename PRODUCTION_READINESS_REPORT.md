## Detailed Analysis

### Current Model Performance Metrics

**Traditional Models:**
- Ridge Regression: MAE=22,217, RÂ²=0.051, Hit Rate=47%
- CatBoost: MAE=17,025, RÂ²=0.001, Hit Rate=47%
- XGBoost: Similar performance patterns

**Causal Impact Analysis (Portfolio-wide):**
- Total Baseline PnL: $70,575.73
- Model Improvement: -$37,525.07 (-53.2%)
- Success Rate: 0% (0 out of 5 traders would improve)
- Statistical Significance: p=0.000441 (significant negative impact)

### Causal Validation Results

The comprehensive causal validation suite shows:
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Tests robustness to unobserved confounders
- **Placebo Tests**: Validates model against random assignments
- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: Provides statistical uncertainty measures
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures stability across different data splits

**Current Assessment**: The model shows statistically significant but negative causal impact, suggesting the trading recommendations may actually harm performance rather than improve it.
