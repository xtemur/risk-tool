# Risk-Tool: Proprietary Trading Risk Management System

## Executive Summary

Risk-Tool is a machine learning-based risk management system designed for proprietary trading firms to predict trader performance and prevent capital losses through proactive risk identification. The system employs a hybrid ensemble approach combining global and trader-specific models to achieve superior predictive accuracy in next-day P&L forecasting.

## Problem Statement

Traditional risk management systems in proprietary trading operate reactively, implementing controls after losses have occurred. With machine learning techniques revolutionizing trading and risk management strategies, there exists an opportunity to transform risk management from reactive to predictive. Current challenges include:

- **Reactive Risk Controls**: Position limits and stop-losses activate after damage is done
- **Limited Personalization**: One-size-fits-all risk parameters fail to account for individual trader patterns
- **Information Asymmetry**: Risk managers lack timely insights into trader-specific risk patterns
- **Capital Inefficiency**: Suboptimal risk allocation leads to unnecessary drawdowns and missed opportunities

## Technical Innovation

### Hybrid Ensemble Architecture

The system implements a state-of-the-art ensemble methodology combining LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms, which have proven superior performance in financial prediction tasks. The architecture consists of:

**Global Model Component**
- Trains on aggregated data from all traders
- Captures market-wide patterns and cross-trader behaviors
- Provides robust predictions for traders with limited history
- Handles cold-start problems for new traders

**Personal Model Component**
- Individual LightGBM models for each trader (minimum 30 trading days)
- Captures trader-specific behavioral patterns and risk preferences
- Adapts to individual trading styles and performance cycles

**Ensemble Strategy**
- Dynamic weighting based on data availability and model confidence
- Confidence-weighted combination of global and personal predictions
- Fallback mechanism ensuring continuous risk assessment

### Feature Engineering Framework
