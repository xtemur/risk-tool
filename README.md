## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No trader data loaded"**
```bash
# Check trader configuration
cat config/trader_accounts.yaml

# Verify data files exist
ls data/raw/*_totals.csv
ls data/raw/*_fills.csv

# Test data download
python -c "from src.propreports_downloader import download_for_risk_tool; download_for_risk_tool()"
```

**"Model training failed"**
```bash
# Check data quality
python -c "from src.data_loader import DataLoader; dl = DataLoader(); data = dl.load_all_traders_data(); print(f'Loaded {len(data)} traders')"

# Run debug notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/debug_system.ipynb
```

**"Email not sending"**
```bash
# Verify email configuration
python -c "import os; print('EMAIL_FROM:', os.getenv('EMAIL_FROM')); print('EMAIL_PASSWORD:', 'SET' if os.getenv('EMAIL_PASSWORD') else 'MISSING')"

# Test email service
python -c "from src.email_service import EmailService; import yaml; config = yaml.safe_load(open('config/config.yaml')); es = EmailService(config); print('Email service OK')"
```

### Getting Help
1. Check logs in `logs/` directory
2. Run the debug notebook for component-level testing
3. Review configuration files for missing settings
4. Validate data quality and model performance
