# Quantitative Risk Modeling System

A sophisticated Python-based system for modeling and monitoring trader risk using machine learning techniques. This system implements advanced time-series analysis, walk-forward backtesting, and real-time monitoring capabilities for quantitative risk management.

## 🎯 Overview

This project provides a complete end-to-end solution for:
- **Risk Prediction**: Predicting Value at Risk (VaR) and large loss probabilities for traders
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detecting patterns like revenge trading and risk clustering
- **Model Monitoring**: Tracking feature drift and model stability in production
- **Causal Impact Analysis**: Measuring the economic impact of risk predictions

The system is designed with the realities of financial data in mind:
- Handles non-stationary market regimes
- Prevents lookahead bias through careful feature engineering
- Manages irregular trading patterns (traders not trading every day)
- Implements rigorous time-series cross-validation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- uv (modern Python package manager)
- Python 3.9+
- SQLite database with trading data

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd risk-tool
```

2. Create and activate the environment using uv:

```bash
# Create virtual environment with Python 3.9+
uv venv --python 3.9

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual credentials and settings
```

4. Ensure your SQLite database is in place at `data/risk_tool.db`

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run full backtest and train production models (with strict CV)
python main.py --mode backtest

   - **In-fold feature selection** to prevent leakage from feature engineering
   - 1-week gaps between training and test periods
   - Prevents all forms of temporal leakage
   - **Performance**: Realistic out-of-sample results (VaR: 8.2% vs 5% expected, Loss AUC: 0.695)

2. **Purged Cross-Validation** (Financial Time Series)

   - Statistical validation with Kupiec tests
   - Advanced convergence monitoring

3. **Standard Time Series CV** (Legacy)

3. Update monitoring logic in `src/monitoring.py`
4. Extend causal impact analysis in `src/causal_impact.py`

## 📚 Key Concepts

### **Temporal Leakage Prevention (Critical)**

**The Challenge**: Financial models often suffer from subtle information leakage where future data inadvertently influences predictions, leading to overly optimistic backtest results that fail in production.

**Our Solution**:
1. **Expanding Window Quantiles**: Large loss thresholds calculated using only historical data up to each point in time
2. **Strict Feature Lagging**: All features shifted by 1+ days with correlation validation
3. **In-Fold Feature Selection**: Feature selection performed within each CV fold to prevent selection bias
4. **Date-Based CV Splits**: True temporal ordering with strict chronological boundaries

### **Enhanced Time Series Cross-Validation**

**Strict Walk-Forward CV** (Default):
- True temporal ordering with date-based splits (not sample-based)
- 1-week gaps between training and test periods
- In-fold feature selection to prevent leakage
- Results: Realistic performance (VaR: 8.2% vs 5% expected, Loss AUC: 0.695)

**Comparison to Standard Methods**:
- **Previous (with leakage)**: Loss AUC 0.987 → 0.703 (massive drop indicating leakage)
- **Fixed (strict CV)**: Loss AUC ~0.75 → 0.695 (realistic degradation)

### **Financial Data Realities**

**Handling Irregular Trading**:
- Complete business day panels with forward-filled risk metrics
- Zero-filled PnL for inactive days
- Trading frequency as behavioral feature

**Market Regime Awareness**:
- Non-stationary distribution handling
- Feature drift monitoring and alerts
- Regime-based model recalibration

## 📧 Daily Risk Signals

The system includes an automated daily risk signal service that generates and emails professional risk reports to stakeholders.

### Signal Generation
```bash
# Generate and save signals (no email)
python send_daily_signals.py --save-only

# Send to default recipients
python send_daily_signals.py

# Send to specific recipients
python send_daily_signals.py --email recipient1@example.com --email recipient2@example.com
```

### Interpreting the Daily Signals

#### **Risk Levels**
- **🔴 HIGH**: Loss probability > 70% or extreme volatility conditions
  - *Action Required*: Immediate position review, consider reducing exposure
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: Loss probability 40-70% or elevated volatility
  - *Monitoring*: Increased attention, prepare contingency plans
- **🟢 LOW**: Normal trading conditions
  - *Standard*: Continue regular monitoring

#### **Value at Risk (VaR)**
- **Definition**: 5th percentile of predicted next-day P&L
- **Example**: VaR of -$5,000 = 95% confidence of not losing more than $5,000
- **Usage**: Sets position limits and risk budgets per trader

#### **Loss Probability**
- **Definition**: Probability of experiencing a "large loss" (bottom 15% historically)
- **Trader-Specific**: Thresholds calibrated to each trader's historical performance
- **Range**: 0-100%, higher values indicate greater risk

#### **Warning Signals**
- **REVENGE_TRADING**: Excessive trading volume following recent losses
- **HIGH_VOLATILITY**: 7-day rolling volatility exceeds historical norms
- **LOW_WIN_RATE**: Win rate below 30% over past 21 trading days
- **LARGE_DRAWDOWN**: Significant peak-to-trough decline in cumulative P&L
- **ELEVATED_RISK**: Loss probability above 40% threshold

#### **Critical Alerts**
Automated flags for extreme situations requiring immediate intervention:
- Multiple consecutive high-risk days
- VaR violations exceeding tolerance
- Behavioral patterns indicating distressed trading

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### **Model Performance & Limitations**

1. **Realistic Expectations**: The system achieves 0.695 AUC for loss prediction - appropriate for noisy financial data
2. **VaR Conservatism**: 8.2% violation rate vs 5% expected indicates conservative risk estimates (safer for risk management)
3. **Temporal Degradation**: Performance naturally degrades on truly unseen data - this is expected and healthy

### **Operational Guidelines**

4. **Data Quality**: The system assumes clean trade data in the SQLite database
5. **Market Regime Changes**: Monitor feature drift reports regularly - consider retraining when drift scores exceed thresholds
6. **Risk Management**: VaR predictions should inform, not replace, human risk management judgment
7. **Signal Interpretation**: Daily signals are predictive tools - combine with market context and trader communication

### **Technical Maintenance**

8. **Model Validation**: Always run `--mode validate` after training to verify model quality
9. **Temporal Leakage Monitoring**: The system includes automatic leakage detection - investigate any warnings
10. **Feature Selection Stability**: Monitor cross-fold feature consistency in validation reports
11. **Automation Monitoring**: Regularly check automation logs and failure notifications
12. **Backup Verification**: Periodically verify backup integrity and recovery procedures

### **Performance Benchmarks**

**Expected Performance Ranges:**
- **VaR Violation Rate**: 5-10% (8.2% is acceptable)
- **Loss Model AUC**: 0.65-0.75 (0.695 is reasonable)
- **Feature Count**: 15-20 selected features per fold
- **Cross-Fold Stability**: <15% variation in key metrics
