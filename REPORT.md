## Statistical Analysis

### Statistical Significance Testing
**Results show statistically significant improvements with important caveats**

| Scenario | Mean Net Benefit | 95% Confidence Interval | p-value | Effect Size | Success Rate |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 25% | $9,275 | $2,343 to $16,746 | 0.037 | Medium (0.73) | 72.7% (8/11) |
| 50% | $24,055 | $7,966 to $41,342 | 0.028 | Large (0.80) | 72.7% (8/11) |
| 70% | $31,327 | $10,993 to $53,573 | 0.022 | Large (0.83) | 72.7% (8/11) |
| 90% | $44,962 | $15,973 to $78,164 | 0.022 | Large (0.82) | 72.7% (8/11) |
